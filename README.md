# Learning the Basics of Blockchain via Naivecoin 

I will be reading and taking notes on the original source material and also doing my own implementation in python.

## Features

- **Basic Blockchain**: Understand blocks, transactions, and chain structure.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a simple consensus mechanism.
- **REST API**: Interact with the blockchain via Flask endpoints.
- **Wallets & Transactions**: Create wallets and perform transactions.
- **Network Nodes**: Connect multiple nodes and achieve consensus.
